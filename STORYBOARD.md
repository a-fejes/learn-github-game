## 🎭 ACT I: The Messy Desk (Level 0)

### Setting
*A cluttered workbench filled with scattered papers, sticky notes, and confusion.*

### The Story
**Narrator (Git-Goat):** 
> "Welcome, brave explorer! Our repository is in chaos. Before we can accept suggestions, we need someone like YOU—someone willing to learn, experiment, and even make mistakes."

### Level Goal

- 🎯 **Visual feedback** - "You've claimed your identity!" confetti

### Pedagogy
Establish that GitHub requires identification. This is about accountability and reputation in open source.

## 🎭 ACT II: The Suggestion Box (Levels 1-2)

### Setting
*A mysterious locked box surrounded by mysterious documents and clues.*

### The Story
**Git-Goat:**
> "Now that I know who you are, your first mission: Find the Suggestion Box issue! It's hidden in our repository. You'll need to SEARCH for it, read it, and ADD YOUR VOICE to the conversation."

## 🎭 ACT IV: The LICENSE Discovery (Level 4)

### Setting
*A glowing library with ancient scrolls. Each scroll represents a file in the repository.*

### The Story
**Git-Goat:**
> "Every great project needs rules of conduct. Find the LICENSE file and understand what rights and responsibilities it grants. Then, add YOUR contribution!"

## 🌀 Parallax & Visual Journey Design

### How Parallax Guides the Journey

**Level 0-1: Horizontal Scroll (Parallax Layers)**
- Foreground: Messy desk items (fast scroll)
- Midground: The repository structure (medium)
- Background: The digital landscape (slow)
- **Effect**: Shows depth of organizational layers

**Level 2: Vertical Parallax (Creating Content)**
- As user types, background scrolls
- Shows the "weight" of their creation
- Words lift up, background falls away
- **Effect**: Their voice becomes important

**Level 3-4: Deep Perspective Parallax**
- Forest scene with multiple depth layers
- Fork shows divergence (2D to 3D representation)
- Each layer represents a different aspect:
  - **Sky** (maintainers' decisions)
  - **Mountains** (the project scope)
  - **Trees** (contributors)
  - **Forest floor** (your local clone)
- **Effect**: Shows their place in the larger ecosystem

**Level 5: Isometric Parallax**
- Stage rotates as celebration happens
- Gives sense of "elevation" to the achievement
- Multiple characters at different depths celebrating
- **Effect**: You're at the center of a community

## 🔄 Mistake Recovery Workflow

### The Safety Net
Players learn that GitHub is FORGIVING:

1. **Created wrong issue?** → Can edit it or delete it
2. **Made typo in comment?** → Can edit comment
3. **Forked by accident?** → Can delete fork
4. **Wrong file edited?** → Can revert changes
5. **PR has issues?** → Can push more commits

This builds CONFIDENCE: Mistakes aren't permanent disasters, they're learning opportunities.
