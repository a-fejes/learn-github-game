# Pedagogy & Level Blueprint

## Philosophy
- Learn by discovery, not link-following; search skills are core.
- Consumer → Creator → Contributor → Community Member.
- Mistakes are safe: edit/delete cycles build confidence.
- Narrative drive with characters as guides, not crutches.

## Level Arc (0–18)
- **0 Identity:** Login; accountability; desk organizes.
- **1 Discovery:** Search “Suggestion Box”; read & comment; search literacy.
- **2 Creation:** Open issue with keywords; comment; close; learn lifecycle.
- **3 Edit Title:** Update closed issue title; revision habit.
- **4 Edit Body:** Improve description; clarity practice.
- **5 Edit Comment:** Fix/expand own comment; ownership.
- **6 Reopen & Clarify:** Reopen → clarify → close; iteration is normal.
- **7 Label:** Add label; organization signals.
- **8 Self-Assign:** Claim work; ownership (note permissions).
- **9 Fork:** Create personal copy; safety to experiment.
- **10 Web Edit:** Pencil edit in fork; no-terminal path.
- **11 Branch (optional):** Branch for bigger changes; optional.
- **12 Commit Message:** Understand snapshot + message value.
- **13 Pull Request:** Ask for merge from fork.
- **14 PR Body:** Improve description/checklist.
- **15 PR Comment:** Self-review/question.
- **16 License:** Ensure LICENSE exists/recognized.
- **17 PR Feedback:** Handle review/closure gracefully.
- **18 Victory:** Recognition; review any level.

## Story & Acts
- **Act I (0-1):** Identity & discovery (search, read, comment).
- **Act II (2):** Creation (your own issue).
- **Act III (3-4):** Responsibility (edit, rules, license/library).
- **Act IV (5+):** Collaboration (PR, review, feedback).
- **Act V (18):** Community recognition.

## Design Patterns
- Search-first tasks (no direct links) to build independence.
- Gentle error handling: live-region alerts, hints, encouragement.
- Parallax/metaphors: desk, forest fork, library spotlight, celebration stage.
- Progress persistence (localStorage) + pending rechecks for API lag.

## Workshop Notes
- Clarify permissions: labels/assign may be restricted on shared repos.
- Encourage fork-first to avoid blockers; remind about rate limits.
- Use optional branch step as “advanced” but not required.

## Future Drill Ideas (19–25)
- Comment on another repo’s issue; repeat label/assign cycles.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md/CODEOWNERS in fork.
- Open/iterate on a second issue; discussion post if enabled.
- PR review simulation with self-review comments.
